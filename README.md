# SBA-308
This website is a small, three-page project designed to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS while focusing on clean design and user-friendly navigation. The site includes a home page, an about page, and a contact page, each following a consistent layout and grid system.

The website features a variety of content types including text, images, and GIFs, and incorporates interactive elements such as forms and dropdown menus. The design emphasizes readability, visual appeal, and a smooth user experience, with complementary colors, responsive layouts, and simple animations to enhance engagement.

The purpose of this project is not only to demonstrate technical HTML and CSS skills but also to show an understanding of how good design impacts user interaction and overall satisfaction.
